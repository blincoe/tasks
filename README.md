To-do:

implement pages / actions: update task, update user, recreate task, close task

enpoints only, no pages: delete task popup, delete user popup

Implement outside actions: weekly email, daily recurring task creation, schedule with cron, maybe one endpoint to control both?

When you close a task, should pop up to ask if you're sure, and if you want to recreate, too fancy, close task home, maybe modify notes

for task list in uer home, show trigger date for pending tasks, show task updated date for open tasks, and show updated date for closed tasks and order by these dates
